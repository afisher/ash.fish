<div class="f4">
  I'm a senior software engineer who builds things for the web. I create
  intuitive browser-based <b>web applications</b> that are
  <b>maintainable</b> and <b>well-tested</b> with <b>teammates</b>
  across multiple functions.

  I live in Portland, Oregon where I enjoy various activities and interests, such as:
  <ul>
    <li><b>gaming</b> - favorite genres include RPGs, strategy, puzzle, and visual novels</li>
    <li><b>art</b> - I love messing around seeing what I can make in Procreate</li>
    <li><b>horror movies</b> - the spookier the better, or thrillers with good twists</li>
    <li><b>walking and hiking</b> - I like to wander around and enjoy nature</li>
    <li><b>admiring cats</b> - I have a feisty tabby that I like to entertain, and I like meeting new cats while out and about</li>
  </ul>
